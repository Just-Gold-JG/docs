# üîê JustGold B2B Partner System  
## Security & Compliance Highlights

---

## 1. Authentication & Authorization
- **HMAC Signature Authentication:**  
  Each API request must include an **HMAC-SHA256 signature** generated using the partner‚Äôs secret key.  
  - Protects against request tampering.  
  - Ensures authenticity of the sender.  
  - Each partner has a unique secret key that must be rotated periodically.  

- **JWT-based Access Control:**  
  Partners can optionally use signed JWTs with **scopes** (e.g., `create:transaction`, `read:transactions`) to enforce least-privilege access.  

- **Client ID & Secret (OAuth2-style):**  
  Issued per partner for application-level authentication, audit, and key rotation.  

---

## 2. Data Security
- **Encryption in Transit:**  
  All traffic is encrypted using TLS 1.2+ with strong cipher suites.  

- **Encryption at Rest:**  
  Sensitive financial and personal data is stored using AES-256 encryption.  

- **Masked Identifiers:**  
  Sensitive identifiers (e.g., transaction IDs, payment references) are tokenized/masked where possible.  

---

## 3. Compliance Standards
- **PCI-DSS Alignment:**  
  Payment flows follow PCI-DSS principles for secure handling of card/payment data.  

- **KYC & AML Support:**  
  Integration-ready for identity verification (via IDWise) and fraud monitoring to meet **regulatory requirements**.  

- **GDPR Compliance:**  
  Data minimization, consent management, and the right to erasure are supported.  

---

## 4. Operational Security
- **Audit Logging:**  
  Every transaction request is logged with timestamp, partner ID, and status for compliance audits.  

- **Rate Limiting & Throttling:**  
  Prevents misuse, fraud, or denial-of-service attempts by partners.  

- **Key & Secret Rotation:**  
  Partners are required to rotate credentials/secrets on a scheduled basis.  

---

## 5. Governance & Monitoring
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**  
  Fine-grained access rules for internal and partner teams.  

- **Continuous Monitoring:**  
  Automated alerts for suspicious API activity, anomalies, or failed authentication attempts.  

- **Secure SDLC:**  
  All JustGold APIs and integrations undergo static/dynamic code analysis and penetration testing.

‚úÖ **Bottom Line**:  
JustGold ensures that all B2B partner integrations are **secure, auditable, and compliant** with financial regulations, while protecting customer trust and partner operations.
